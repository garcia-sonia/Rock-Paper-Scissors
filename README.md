Firstly I would like to thank my mentor Richard Wells and the Community at Code Institute for their guidance and support throughout this JavaScrip Project Portfolio2.

I also got inspiration from Ania Kub√≥w's awesome video 3 ways to code Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript and used this as a starting point although overall my JS code varies significantly and contains further features and functions.

Otherwise, I relied mainly upon content from W3schools and CI LMS tutorials for this project.

## Content Inspiration

All content in the game "Rock Papers Scissors by the Sea" was written by myself.
The Seaside Pirate theme was inspired by my daughters' ideas as so was the choice of Emojis and Clip art pgn images across the site.
