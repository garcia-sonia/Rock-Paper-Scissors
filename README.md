Rock Paper Scissors by the Sea

Features
    Features left to implement

# Testing 
- I used Edge, Chrome and Firefox desktop browsers to ensure cross-compatibility.
- I used DevTools to simulate different smaller screen sizes down to 320px in width as well as testing on several personal devices including Android tablets and mobile phones.
- I asked my mentor and friends and relatives to test the website on Opera and iOS and no errors were reported.
- I asked my network to test the functionality of the game on their devices, to click every button and check every modal box and to also check for typos, etc. No errors were reported.
- Finally, as detailed below, I used several validator tools like Nu HTML checker, W3C CSS validator tool, and JSHint to check and no warnings are being flagged at the time of this submission.

## Issues and fixes

## Validator testing
- HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/nu/
  - Issue found: The validator flagged that the third h3 tag in the current-game-display div was empty of content. The reason why this h3 tag was empty of content was that it simply announces the winner of the round and displays different JS content depending on who wins each round (i.e. "You win", "You lose", "It's a draw").
  - Fix: I simply added three suspension points inside the h3 html tag as placeholder which also adds to the idea of suspense on who is going to win the round.
Game is now fully validated with no HTML errors.

- CSS Validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
  - The CSS code was validated as CSS Level3 +SVG with no errors found.

- JavaScrip Validator: https://jshint.com/
  - Issue found: missing semi-colons at the end of several lines.
  - Fix: semi-colons added
JS code shows no warnings at the time of this submission. As highlited by the JS linter, there are 12 functions in this file. The function with the largest signature takes 1 argument, while the median is 0. The largest function has 21 statements in it, while the median is 2. The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 14 while the median is 1.

## Contrast testing
- WCAG Color contrast checker: The score reported was AAA as seen in screenshot below:

## Performance, Accessibility, Best practices and SEO testing with Lighthouse
Test conditions:
- All lighthouse tests were carried out in incognito mode to avoid interference from browser extensions.
- All tests were run for both mobile and desktop.
- The scores shown are the final scores after fixing the accessibility issue mentioned in the "Issues and Fixes" section above.

# Credits 

## Technical Reference

Firstly I would like to thank my mentor Richard Wells and the Community at Code Institute for their guidance and support throughout this JavaScrip Project Portfolio2.

I also got inspiration from Ania Kub√≥w's awesome video [3 ways to code Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFeg0cEZvQ) and used this as a starting point although overall my JS code varies significantly and contains further features and functions.

Otherwise, I relied mainly upon content from W3schools and CI LMS tutorials for this project.

## Content Inspiration

All content in the game "Rock Papers Scissors by the Sea" was written by myself.
The Seaside Pirate theme was inspired by my daughters' ideas as so was the choice of Emojis and Clip art pgn images across the site.
